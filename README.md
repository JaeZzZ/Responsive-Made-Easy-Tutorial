# Responsive-Made-Easy-Tutorial
Most of this code is from the Responsive Made Easy tutorial taught by Kevin Powell on Youtube. 

# Highlights (for me) from this tutorial
1. using em and rem vs px
2. for children of a flex container to take up equal space, you can set a flex-basis of 100%
3. focus on common styles first in css, then move on to add more complexity
4. as for mobile design, you can do your basic styling and then add complexity via media queries
5. use :root to declare global css variables, which are easy to change in the future
6. using width: min(value-0, value-1); where the max width is value-1, but will shrink according to value-0 (must use units like vw or %)
